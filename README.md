### REAL Stack

The REAL stack is an evolutionary ~~ideology~~  ~~platform~~ ~~framework~~ ~~architecture~~ mental model for building modern web applications and sites at scale, focusing on a small set of tools and services.

REAL stands for React, Express, AWS Lambda , representing a move from operating systems and containers to serverless architectures as well as the hard lines around front-end and back-end coding.

In effect, the REAL Stack is about changing the scope of "full-stack" to a more limited view so that  the notion becomes attainable while enabling a move to product-focused and feature-driven mindset.

REAL calls out specific technologies in its name partly for branding, but also because, to the authors, it represents a reasonable state of the art and a fixed-point at which future discussions can occur.
